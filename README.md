# Obsidian ICS Plugin

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It adds events from google calendar ics URLs to your Daily Note on demand.

This only works with the Daily Note or [Periodic Notes](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) plugins: specifically it gets the date to search for events during from the currently open daily note.

## Development state

The plugin mostly works though I've seen it occasionally [miss some recurring events](https://github.com/muness/obsidian-ics/issues/36). Once I fix those I'll submit it to the Obsidian Community plugin marketplace. PRs and other help welcome!

## Installation

Manual Installation

1. Download the latest `obsidian-ics.zip` file from [releases](https://github.com/muness/obsidian-ics/releases).
2. Unpack the file. It should create a `obsidian-ics` folder.
3. Place the folder in your .obsidian/plugins directory
4. Reload plugins
5. Activate the `ICS` plugin

## Usage

1. From Google Calendar, look for the calendar in the left sidebar click the vertical … menu, Settings and Sharing, Integrate calendar, Copy the Secret address in iCal format
2. Enter that URL into settings with a calendar name
3. Go to a daily note, use the `ICS: Import events` command
